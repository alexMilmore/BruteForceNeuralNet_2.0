# bruteForceNeuralNet_2.0
Improved version of brute force neural net code running in docker containers

# What this is for
While doing my masters project I had to classify healthy and sick patients using a relativly small dataset. Because of the small dataset and high signal to noise ratio in the image it was vital that the correct architecture for a neural net was chosen. Instead of hand testing architectures this program was built. Allowing the user to set the broad strokes of neural nets to be tested, and the program would autonomously test hundereds of variations architectures.

# Using
This program uses a web server as the front end, type localhost into your browser to use it.
NOTE; do not use this as a server across the internet, it is currently very unsecure and has been designed for local use only.

Once you are on the webpage, there should be instructions to explain what to do
